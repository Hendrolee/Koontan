# Koontan - Expenses Manager

Koontan is an expense manager application to help you calculate your group bills and expenses.\
Removing the need for a single person to record and calculate the group expenses.

## Why?

I wanted a tool that allows you to:

- Record your group expenses in the easiest way.
- Tell you how much money you owe to the others.

## Running this project locally

From the repo:

- Clone this project locally
- Run `npm install` in your bash / command line
- Run `npm start` in your bash / command line
- Start adding expenses!

## Features to Implement

This project is at its early stage of development, some variables are hardcoded. For example, the `sharedWith` value and debts filter value assigned to `Patrick`.

In the future it will be made dynamic. User will be able to filter through list of debts and expenses.

There are lists of features that I want to implement:

- Welcome page.
- Ability to sign up and log in.
- Create group session.
- Invite members through email.
- Display details of each debt.

## Dev Dependencies

- react-redux
- reactjs/toolkit
- react-DOM
